Grab a tea and listen a while.\r\n\r\n## Why did I stop?!\r\n\r\nI _really_ enjoy taking a lot of different courses, and I would often put The Odin Project at the back of this ever-growing list of tutorials and general online courses. Often running to my wife like a kid that just spotted the next new Prime energy drink flavour is in stock, exclaiming and swearing how much better this new flavour is compared to the previous. Convincing myself how this next course could eventually become useful to me, I open my browser in incognito mode to make sure it's on sale and check out. Just ignore the courses in my Udemy course list that haven't been opened since I bought them a year ago, _those_ courses are the exception.. Right? Right!?\r\n\r\nThankfully, I did in fact manage to stick to JavaScript as my language of choice, and I've no doubt that the courses I _have_ used have helped me better myself as a programmer.\r\n\r\n_However, sometimes I really wish I had just stuck to The Odin Project._\r\n\r\nWell, I have decided that's exactly what I'm going to do! Unfortunately, my last project with TOP was completed well over 6 months ago, so I found the last project I had completed and decided to do re-do the project before that one to make sure I'm really caught up, which is in fact the Library Project.\r\n\r\n## I am guilty of a crime.\r\n\r\nAs part of the The Odin Project's curriculum, after I had completed the foundations and made it to the full-stack JavaScript section of the course, I was tasked with creating a simple web page app that will display a list of books that the user can add/remove from the page using a form input. Essentially a CRUD app.. Without the U, I guess? A CRD? (K-uh-rd)!\r\n\r\nI open the code-editor, I read my previous, older code, noticing that I'd used ES6 classes instead of factory functions, nodding along approvingly to myself as I scroll, proud of past-Dave. It's just all so.. Perfect!? The app is flawless, a true gem of vanilla JS, programmers will kneel in awe of my awesome coding skills!\r\n\r\nAll I need to do now is re-create it as best I can. I begin a new project, decide to keep the HTML and CSS to save myself time, allowing me to focus on the JavaScript. I open script.js, I put my fingers to the keyboard aaaand, nothing.\r\n\r\n![coding-problems](/src/images/coding-trouble.png 'Optional title')\r\n\r\nFor the life of me, I could not remember how I'd used classes the way I had in the previous projects code. In fact, why were there ES6 classes and not factory functions to begin with? The project constraints explicitly states that I should use factory functions.\r\n\r\nAnd then I remembered.\r\n\r\nPast-Dave was in fact guilty of a crime, the crime of completing a code-along 'Tracalorie app' tutorial that used OOP and ES6 classes, and copying that code into the Library Project and altering it to work with this new project. You could argue that this is still a form of learning as I wasn't just copy and pasting, I was making the code work by adding/removing as I needed, but clearly I did not retain as much as I had thought.\r\n\r\nI recall that somewhere later in TOP's course, they ask you to re-factor your factory functions into ES6 classes, and as I already had the code.. And I was going to re-factor the factory functions anyway.. I just skipped them altogether.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the way, I believe began to see these projects as something that I needed to 'get through', to get to the 'real learning', when obviously, the projects were the real learning all along. Not the tutorials, not the long-winded blogs, and especially not the code-alongs.\r\n\r\n#### Atoning for my sins.\r\n\r\nYes, I did in fact manage to re-develop the Library Project using factory functions by following the requirements closely. No, I did not whip myself repeatedly on the back yelling \"JS Classes are just syntactic sugar!\"\r\n\r\nI realise now that The Odin Project curriculum, as stated many times during the course, is very carefully planned. I should not have skipped factory functions because they're 'not as common', or try to illude myself into the idea that completing a code-along is the next best thing to doing the project itself.\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, I got stuck a lot, frustrated and often questioned where I actually am in my journey to becoming a full-time web-developer, but I did it. I'll be following the course more closely from now on and posting my successes and failures here on my blog site.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out.\r\n";
